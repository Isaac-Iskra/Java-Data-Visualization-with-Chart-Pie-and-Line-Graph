# Java-Data-Visualization-with-Chart-Pie-and-Line-Graph
A Chart, Pie, and Line chart code using Java

The code is a Java code snippet that demonstrates data visualization of a bar chart, a pie chart, and a line graph using the JFreeChart library.

In the first section, it creates a dataset for a bar chart using the DefaultCategoryDataset class and populates it with sample data. It then creates a BarChart object and sets the dataset to the chart. Finally, it creates a chart panel using the ChartPanel class and adds it to a JFrame to display the bar chart.

In the second section, it creates a dataset for a pie chart using the DefaultPieDataset class and populates it with sample data. It then creates a PieChart object and sets the dataset to the chart. Finally, it creates a chart panel using the ChartPanel class and adds it to a JFrame to display the pie chart.

In the third section, it creates a dataset for a line graph using the XYSeriesCollection class and populates it with sample data. It then creates an XYLineChart object and sets the dataset to the chart. Finally, it creates a chart panel using the ChartPanel class and adds it to a JFrame to display the line graph.
